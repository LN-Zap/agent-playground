# Security Policy

## Reporting a vulnerability

Please do not open a public issue for potential security vulnerabilities.

Instead, report privately via GitHub Security Advisories:

- Go to the repository Security tab
- Use "Report a vulnerability"

If that is unavailable, contact repository maintainers directly.

## What to include

Please include:

- Affected files/components
- Reproduction details or proof of concept
- Impact assessment
- Suggested remediation (if known)

## Response goals

- Initial acknowledgement: within 3 business days
- Triage/severity assessment: within 7 business days
- Remediation target: based on severity and exploitability

## Scope notes

This repository uses pinned action SHAs and deterministic generation flows. Security reports related to workflow supply-chain integrity and secret handling are especially valuable.
