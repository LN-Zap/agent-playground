# Guidelines for Adding or Modifying Features

- Keep `README.md` synchronized with the implemented functionality.
- When updating MCP entries in `README.md`, make each tool name a human-friendly link.
- Prefer links in this order: official MCP/product documentation page, then official repository page.
- Avoid linking tool names to raw MCP transport endpoints (for example, `.../mcp`) unless no public docs/repo page exists.
- Verify links resolve and are useful for setup/usage (installation, configuration, or tool reference), not just homepages.
