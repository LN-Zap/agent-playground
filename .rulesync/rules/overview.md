# Workflow

Always use the Ask Questions or Seamless Agent tools for ALL interactions with me - including asking questions, proposing plans, sharing updates, requesting confirmation, and general conversation - except final sign-off acknowledgements, which should be plain responses with no tool call.

**IMPORTANT:** Always start the session by stating your name.
